// That's great progress! Since you've learned map, filter, find, forEach, reduce, and class inheritance, here are some basic problems to help you practice and strengthen your understanding ‚Äî no code, just challenges:

// üîÅ Array Method Challenges
// 1. Map Challenge

// You have an array of numbers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
// Create a new array where each number is doubled.

// 2. Filter Challenge

// You have an array of ages: [12, 18, 24, 10, 30]
// Filter out the ages that are less than 18.

// 3. Find Challenge

// You have an array of names: ["Ali", "John", "Max", "Alina"]
// Find the first name that starts with the letter "A".

// 4. forEach Challenge

// You have an array of prices: [100, 200, 300]
// Print each price with a 10% tax added using forEach.

// 5. Reduce Challenge

// You have an array of marks: [70, 85, 90, 75]
// Find the average mark using reduce.

// üß± Class & Inheritance Challenges
// 6. Basic Class

// Create a class Person with properties: name and age.
// Add a method to return a string like "Alice is 25 years old".

// 7. Class Inheritance

// Create a class Student that inherits from Person.
// Add an extra property grade, and a method to return:
// "Alice is in grade A".

// 8. Encapsulation with private fields

// Create a class BankAccount with a private field #balance.
// Add methods to deposit, withdraw, and getBalance.

// 9. Class with Array Method

// Create a class Cart that has a list of items (array of prices).
// Add a method that returns the total price using reduce.

// 10. Chaining Array Methods

// Given an array of numbers, remove the odd ones, double the even ones, and return the sum of the result.
